fourch (stylized as 4ch) is a wrapper to the 4chan JSON API, provided by moot. It allows you to interact with 4chan (in a READONLY way) easily through your scripts.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 (what I test with, 2.x might work)
- requests

Notes
-----

- This isn't guaranteed to work all the time; after all, the API may change, and 4ch will have to be updated accordingly.
- If a feature is missing, open an issue on the `repo`_, and it may well be implemented.

Running / Usage
---------------

- Install & import: ``$ pip install 4ch``, ``import fourch``
- See the `docs`_

Contributing
------------
If you're interested in contributing to the usability of 4ch, or just want to give away stars, you can visit the 4ch github `repo`_.
